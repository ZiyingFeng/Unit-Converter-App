# Unit-Converter-App
In this assignment, we want you to create an iOS app that calculates the conversion from one unit to another using what you have learned about variables and functions. Use the video guide to help you navigate the details.

Your application should include a UITextField for the user to put the initial measurement into. It should be paired with a UILabel clarifying which units the input is in.

Below this should be a UISegmentedControl with 3 segments. Each segment should have a different unit that the user can convert their single input to. It will have to be the same kind of unit (e.g., a length to a length, a volume to a volume)

Below the segment controll should be a button.

When the button is clicked the interface should evaluate which segment is selected and convert the input to the appropriate unit.
